# CPU-Instruction-Processing-Simulator-Part-2
The idea of the project is to demonstrate simulation of CPU instruction processing life cycle.

Given a list of instructions to be fed to CPU, it can tell how many cycles it will take to process them all, 

displaying execution results in each stage.

There are 5 pipelined stages of instruction processing viz. Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory and Write Back.

The simulator uses many techniques such as Parallel Processing, Register Renaming, Reorder Buffer (ROB), 

Out-of-order processing, analyzing and avoiding data hazards such as RAW, WAW and WAR.
